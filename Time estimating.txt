I prefer parametric + pessimistic time estimation for these reasons:

a) Previous projects are likely to provide an agile centric view of the time needed, and depending on project experiences it may even take less time than the last.
b) Pessimistic and broad terms keep things within reason, and allow story points with effort evaluations to become the point of interest; IE this will take hours, this will take days, this will take weeks, or this will take months to complete.
c) Data does not always suffice, and judgement is required to ensure that the estimate aligns to previous/recurring data.

To conclude, expert judgement is the final contender, as data alone is only a stepping stone to good estimation.
