Reflection on the "Getting Real" textbook pages 75-81

Talking points:

    - Inter-Department collaboration is ideal.
    - Jacks of all trades can be beneficial to outcomes.
    - Meetings should only be used to define concepts that aren't clear and are toxic. Usually because the amount of 
    preparation required to make a meeting worthwhile is not met by all parties.
    - Make loosely coupled work-groups.

This chapter focuses intensely on keeping things brief, and looking for quick features from time to time. 
As a company grows in size, departmental communication can become too specialized, and it is ideal to find ways to 
ensure that a jack of all trades is present or hired if possible, and that employees effectively communicate their 
duties to other departments to ensure no scheme of the project is lost.

I found it confusing that the chapter discussed inter-department collaboration, but then went on to say it is good to 
break your company into small independent groups. I think that the point they were trying to convey is that this type 
of departmental makeup is best served for the company you are working for, but work needs to be done to ensure fluid 
and quick communications rather than timely and potentially drawn out meetings, and presents an image that most 
people find this to be the case in a corporate environment.
