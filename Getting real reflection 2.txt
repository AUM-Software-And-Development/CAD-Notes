Reflection on the "Getting Real" textbook pages 12-24

This section mostly covered the art of not competing, and going all in on the features that you are passionate about 
regardless of what is perceptibly a need for a product. Having a passion can generate hits, and not overextending 
your passion, but staying strictly within its own limitations seemed to be emphasized, as a reference to constraints. 
Keeping your ideas from staying out on the fringes and tying them back down was noted, as a counterpart to attempting 
to compete with what's already made it to the fringe needs or use cases, and getting stuck in space. I could compare 
it to gravity, as gravity keeps you grounded - but it's ok to play sports, and toss a ball around from time to time. 
That generates interest.
