• Describe your emails

Keeping emails separated allows for better task tracking and appropriateness of the email dictation towards your 
specific job. The CC inbox was a good idea that I would like to utilize, and is simple to implement by adding an email filter to all of my inboxes.

• Don't ignore, consolidate and organize, then ignore

Utilizing task tracking apps, and tabular consolidators are an example of this to ensure certain items are focused 
upon, and the proper items are ignored.

• Defer and delegate

Don't respond to individual issues (this is the most relevant to agile), such as emails that have little relevance, 
but instead write a broad post on a blog for multiple users to see including that emailer.
