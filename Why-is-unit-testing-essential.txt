Unit testing is extremely important for runtime centric environments, and class based code. The scope of a project 
can quickly become grand, and especially so when you are operating with external entry points such as servers, or 
the ASP.NET framework; so defining a context for testing early on prevents crucial components from breaking if there 
are errors upon entry into the primary server loop being focused on by the kernel. Since everything operates on a 
loop, you don't want to throw a wrench into your gears.
