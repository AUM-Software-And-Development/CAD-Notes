"Getting Real" reflection on pages one hundred and three through one hundred and thirteen:

Write less software. Find alternatives to verbose solutions that take up the least amount of time possible, and use 
solutions that won't be discouraging if changes need to be made. Informing customers of your software limitations is 
a valid way to reduce features that your product either isn't ready for yet, or could complicate it beyond your 
resources.

It is also recommended that you build for the idea of allowing access to data, as that has improved their sales 
reach.
