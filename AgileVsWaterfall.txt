Agile would be described as dynamic. Similar to the comparison of monolithic application development vs. application 
development centered on micro services. These are models that display the forwards moving structure of the world, 
where through trial and error over time, it has been discovered that utilizing a more flexible approach (Agile), 
produces better outcomes both for clients, and for producers.

Using Agile, goals and deadlines are approached with fluidity in the workspace environment. Such fluidity remains 
rigid as a partially monolithic approach within each makeup sector of a time based referendum. Referendums typically 
run for nearly 30 days. Stakeholders are expected to receive input and output, and be part of the continuous 
delivery feedback loop. This allows the state of the application or service to be developed in a more natural 
fashion, without potential unrelated offshoots, as each need is expected to be revised at the start of the next 
sprint.

The waterfall methodology is part of the monolithic application development process, which follows rigid structure 
with one end goal in mind. Should that goal change, the steps must be reiterated, which is equivalent in most cases 
to a rewrite, and can become very impactful on outcomes and deadlines. These plans are known to be too stringent 
for many companies, and with farsighted developer thought processes that do not always deliver the product right 
the first time, but for some systems they are known to work, for example, an electrical engineer may consider the 
rigidity of this structure first, over seeking ways to coincide with a software first team that may not be meant 
for quick acting online services.
