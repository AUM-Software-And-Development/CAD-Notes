Continuous integration is automated implementation, and validation of code repositories, but not deployment. It is 
useful for ensuring that updates do not break the product being offered prior to deployment. Pros include the 
ability to automate pre-deployment procedures, and the ability to keep logs of issues as they are associated with 
each integration. Cons include potentially high resource usage, convolution of procedures when it isn't always 
needed, and validation queues.
