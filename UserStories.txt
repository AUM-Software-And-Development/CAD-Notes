= User stories can/might be one of the most common backlog items during a sprint.
= They are good practice for keeping the project succinct


User stories should
• Describe one software feature that the customer needs
• Be non technical and without technical terms
• Be written from the customer's perspective
User stories shouldn't
• Be long essays
• Use technical terms
• Be aware of specific development standards/libraries


Example:
As a moviegoer, I can send my review.
