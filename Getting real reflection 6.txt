Reflection on the "Getting Real" textbook pages 59-74

Key points:

• Application should be have components that are operational asap.

• Use sketches then develop a ui to get an idea of where things must go.

• Keep preferences relevant to the customer. This tends to mean less of them.

• Feedback from launched apps presents errors you might not think of.

 

This chapter covers getting a visible product running quickly to use as a frame for results. Similar to needing to 
build a frame for a car before you can place its engine, something has to get built. Experiences tend to be better 
when customers aren't inundated, and actual feedback is crucial to ensuring an app isn't based on bias.
