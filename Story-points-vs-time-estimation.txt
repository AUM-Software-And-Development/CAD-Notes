Agile story points vs time estimation by Eric Dee

I prefer the two way approach. If I were to prioritize one over the other, I would pick story points first, and then 
time estimation. This is because a story point can inherit a time frame from previous story points that held the same 
difficulty value as a predisposed estimate. I would still like to add in a loose time frame in every story in the 
format of hours, days, weeks, months.
