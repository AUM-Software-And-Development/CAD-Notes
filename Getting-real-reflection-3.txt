Reflection on the "Getting Real" textbook pages 25-35

This thinking felt off the mark for me, because my job search taught me that the majority of the development field 
does not actually think that way, they only want to think that they do think that way; when in reality, if you are 
presented with an actual constraint, or someone who has broken the mold, the most likely factoral outcome is 
rejection; which derives from current circumstances, and the inability to react - on time. Compound that with the 
abundance of programmers who clearly know it all, and the waters are treacherous and cold.

I say that, because I saw many people act certain ways during one of the most painful times I have ever experienced 
in my 31 years of living; which I would call a job search in this field. Many people complain about it online. It 
seems to tie very deeply into HR practices;

That would be theoretical discussion however, something that is not adopted throughout whole companies, but only 
specified sects. A great programmer might never make it through an HR reps facilitating guise. Like the eye of 
Souron, or the famous One Wilshire data center on the West Coast. Only those who know the gaze, and the struggle to 
reach your peers will ever find out.

The idea is to work within these constraints that we are learning day by day; we only, have imposed upon ourselves. 
As each new scrappy group comes to realize, their thoughts as they were in the purest, and rawest format tend to be 
the best ones. It is the longstanding, and tried and true methods that have continued to fail. Utilizing techniques 
that facilitate change are continuing to prove that they are satisfactory for greater levels of success, or in the 
authors eyes, have proven effective enough to write a manifesto. A manifesto, which they may one day have to deem 
still too inflexible, if they follow their words against the tried and true.
