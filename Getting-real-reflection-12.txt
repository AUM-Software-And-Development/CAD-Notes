Reflection written by Eric Dee about the book "Getting Real"
Pages 125-130:

Have a free product. This can act as a backbone for the
company, and creating a valuable product that has use
without being a paid product generates interest in your
company.

A lot of companies use a free base model, such as GitKraken,
and others have staple products that act as a company
advertisement, such as Apple's iTunes.

Customers need to be able to access and cancel their
subscription seamlessly. Otherwise they will hate your 
company, and everything it makes. Nobody likes a cheater.

Also make sure they have access to their data if they
choose to leave. There are some laws about this as well 
for some products like eCommerce.

Lastly, avoid contracts, and "earn it", which means earn
the money that you make instead of locking people into
things that most people generally don't like.
